# PocketPot

### Overview

- Base functionality - a mobile jackpot tool that lets users:
    - Add players to a new game
    - Keep track of player's chips, bets, and the pot
- Planned Future Funtionality
    - A multiplayer (using websockets) game reminiscent of poker, but more abstract
    - More details TBA

## Current Status
- Users can keep track bets/jackpot through a turn based system (pass and play)
- Users can (optionally) use digital cards and play a full game of poker, so no cards required

##ToDo
- Better user interfaces, with a priority focus on mobile/smaller viewports
- In-between bet messages to prevent accidental card exposure during a pass and play session
- Better visual feedback
- Call/Check/Fold/Raise buttons (cut down on user having to click individual chips to bet)
